# Landing Page
This is my landing page project while working my way through The Odin Project curriculum.

You can view the page [here](https://newmanem23.github.io/landing-page/) if you wish. 

The purpose of this project was to get familiar with using the flex box layout
and aligning different elements on a webpage.
